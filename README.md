# Museum-backend 
This repo is a Rails backend of my Museum project. I decided to have two seperate repositories for this project and therefore the link to the javascript frontend of this project is https://github.com/JOCOghub/react-final. This project uses AJAX and javascript to make fetch requests to this rails backend to access a database containing information about varried museums and the exhibits that belong to them. The Front end of this project is run on React and Redux. React is a javascript library that is incredibly fast because it uses a virtual DOM that updates the real DOM with as little manipulation as apossible making the application very fast. Redux makes it easier to seperate handling information and logic by being able to import actions and set the state to what we need it to be. x
